# PINN Temporal Graph Learning Configuration (Unsupervised)

# Model Architecture
model:
  n_nodes: 100  # Will be set to number of samples in data
  node_dim: 16
  n_eigengenes: 5  # Will be inferred from data

# Training Parameters

# Loss Weights
loss_weights:
  reconstruction: 1.0      # MSE between predicted and true eigengenes
  physics: 0.001           # Derivative consistency between network and graph
  tree: 0.001              # Tree structure constraint (reduced for sparse graphs)
  negative: 1    # Sign consistency along paths
  sparsity: 0         # Sparsity constraint (further reduced to allow edges)
